## Descriptive Wiki:

The `/users` endpoint is used to manage user data. It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods. To retrieve user data, a GET request can be made to the `/users?id={id}` endpoint, where `{id}` is the ID of the user to retrieve. To create a new user, a POST request can be made to the `/users` endpoint with the user's name, email, and password in the request body. To update an existing user, a PUT request can be made to the `/users?id={id}` endpoint with the updated user data in the request body. To delete a user, a DELETE request can be made to the `/users?id={id}` endpoint.

The endpoint requires authentication and authorization to access. If a request is made without proper authentication or authorization, a 401 Unauthorized error will be returned. If a request is made to a resource that does not exist, a 404 Not Found error will be returned.

The endpoint also implements rate limiting to
