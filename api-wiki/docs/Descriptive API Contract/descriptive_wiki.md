### `/users` Endpoint:
The `/users` endpoint allows for the management of user data. It supports GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE methods.

#### GET Method:
The GET method retrieves user data by ID. The parameter `id` is required. If successful, it will return the user's `id`, `name`, and `email`. If the user is not found, it will return a 404 error with a `message` indicating that the resource was not found.

Example: `GET /users?id=123`

#### POST Method:
The POST method creates a new user. The `name`, `email`, and `password` are required fields and must be provided in the request body. If successful, it will return a 201 status code with the new user's `id` and a `message` indicating success. If the request is invalid, it will return a 400 error with a `message` indicating that the request was invalid.

Example: `POST /users`
```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com",
  "password": "password123"
}
```

#### PUT Method:
The PUT method updates an existing user. The `id` parameter is required and the `name`, `email`, and `password` fields must be provided in the request body. If successful, it will return a 200 status code with a `message` indicating success. If the user is not found, it will return a 404 error with a `message` indicating that the resource was not found.

Example: `PUT /users?id=123`
```
{
  "name": "Jane Doe",
  "email": "janedoe@example.com",
  "password": "newpassword"
}
```

#### DELETE Method:
The DELETE method deletes a user by ID. The `id` parameter is required. If successful, it will return a 200 status code with a `message` indicating success. If the user is not found, it will return a 404 error with a `message` indicating that the resource was not found.

Example: `DELETE /users?id=123`

## Error Handling:
The API contract defines four error codes: 400, 401, 404
